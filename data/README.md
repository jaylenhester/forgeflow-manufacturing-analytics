# Data Directory

This project **does not track raw datasets in git**.  
To reproduce the analysis, you must download the source data yourself and place it in the correct folders.

## Folder Structure

- `data/raw/`  
  Original CSV files as downloaded from the source (Olist, SECOM, etc.).
- `data/interim/`  
  Intermediate outputs from cleaning/merging steps.
- `data/processed/`  
  Final analysis-ready tables used for modeling and dashboards.
- `data/external/`  
  Any third-party or reference datasets.

## 1. Olist – Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset

Source (Kaggle):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

Download the dataset bundle and extract the CSV files.  
Place the following files into `data/raw/olist/` (create the folder if it doesn’t exist):

- `olist_orders_dataset.csv`
- `olist_customers_dataset.csv`
- `olist_order_items_dataset.csv`
- `olist_order_payments_dataset.csv`
- `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv`
- `olist_products_dataset.csv`
- `olist_sellers_dataset.csv`
- `olist_geolocation_dataset.csv`  ← **large file, not tracked in git**

Your final path should look like:

- `data/raw/olist/olist_orders_dataset.csv`
- `data/raw/olist/olist_geolocation_dataset.csv`
- etc.

## 2. SECOM – Semiconductor Manufacturing Dataset

Source (UCI Machine Learning Repository):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paresh2047/uci-semcom

Download:

- `uci-secom.csv`

Place them into `data/raw/secom/`:

- `data/raw/secom/uci-secom.csv`

## 3. Synthetic Production Data (ForgeFlow)

Synthetic data for the household appliance manufacturer (microwaves, vacuums, coffee makers) is generated by the `forgeflow.synth` module.

To regenerate it, run (example in a notebook or script):

```python
from forgeflow.synth import SynthConfig, make_production
from forgeflow.io import write_interim_csv

cfg = SynthConfig(n_days=365, seed=42)
prod_df = make_production(cfg)

write_interim_csv(prod_df, "forgeflow/production_synth.csv")



Conventions:
- CSVs UTF-8, comma-delimited, headers present.
- Dates ISO-8601; times in UTC unless stated.
- One table = one file unless partitioned by date.
