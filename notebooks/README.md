Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, prototyping, and reporting.

Planned structure:

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`  
  - Smoke tests for `forgeflow.paths`, `forgeflow.io`, `forgeflow.synth`, `forgeflow.clean`, `forgeflow.features`.  
  - Initial EDA on synthetic production data and, later, Olist/SECOM.

- `02_data_synthesis.ipynb` (later)  
  - More detailed synthetic-data scenarios (different plant configs, stress tests).

- `03_clean_merge.ipynb` (later)  
  - Cleaning and merging Olist + SECOM + synthetic production data.

- `04_feature_engineering.ipynb` (later)  
  - Applying feature engineering at scale and persisting to `data/processed`.

- `05_modeling_quality.ipynb` / `06_modeling_logistics.ipynb` (later)  
  - Dedicated notebooks for the two major modeling tracks.

- `07_dashboard_prep.ipynb` (later)  
  - Exporting curated tables for Tableau dashboards.
